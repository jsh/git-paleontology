## Everyone Loves Paleontology

The first widely adopted international standard may have been [Linnaeus's 1758 scheme for naming living things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature). Still, even today, not that many software engineers know "Latin names" of plants and animals. Try this quiz. (Answers are at the links.)

- [*Turdus migratorius*?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_robin)
- [*Triticum aestivum*?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wheat)

Knowing what the words mean helps. *migratorius* means it migrates. *Triticum* is probably the supine of *terere* -- thus, "that which is about to be ground." And *aestivum* means "summer."

- [*Lycopersicum esculentum*?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato)

Latin doesn't help when the etymology is Greek. *Esculentum*, from the Latin, means it's edible. But *Lycopersicum* is from λύκος: wolf + περσικόν: peach: the edible wolf-peach.

Don't give up yet, though. Here's another. What's the Latin name of this?

![T. rex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Sues_skeleton.jpg/440px-Sues_skeleton.jpg "*Tyrannosaurus rex*")

Every ten-year-old can name dinosaurs. People who can't program in Go or even get out of high school can name dinosaurs. People who don't speak English can name dinosaurs. This one's *T. rex*. How many horns does a *Triceratops* have?

We all love fossils.
